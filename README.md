# Database-Connections
I have tried different database access methods and realized that they are big milestones to beginners,
*********************************
When I began coding using the most famous php , I remember spending a couple of hours , days ,and weeks trying to solve my MYSQL database connection until I took the problem to my web based applications lecturer for help but still left without concrete help.
Later , I went into books and realized that such struggle upgraded my skills in backend skills since I never stopped at getting the solution but went ahead doing a deep comparison on the different plugins for database connections such as Object Oriented Style,Mysqli,PDO
